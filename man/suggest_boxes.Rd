\title{Suggest a number of sub-compartments to obtain a suitable distribution of transition times}
\usage{
suggest_boxes(mean, sd)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean}{the desired mean waiting time}

\item{sd}{the desired standard deviation in waiting time}
}
\value{
the function returns a ggplot object illustrating the suggestions,
and prints the suggested number of sub-compartments and rates to screen
}
\description{
This is a utility function that takes a desired mean and standard deviation for
the distribution of transit times through a disease compartment, and suggests
a suitable rate and number of sub-compartments that matches the provided mean
and variance as closely as possible.
