# IPDMR
R package supporting the introduction to practical disease modelling course


## TODO:

Add mort TO SEIR class, i.e. mortality with no replacement

Add signal interrupt

More flexible freq vs dens by adjusting divide_by (as a function of N???)

... for make_group for parameters etc (or actually give arguments)

Don't return self for basic examples


Use loops for 3B and 4B (no functional), and introduce R6 more gently


Publish package???
