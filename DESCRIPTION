Description: A collection of functions and classes that are used to illustrate
  fundamental concepts of disease modelling as part of a physical course series
  taught jointly by the University of Copenhagen and University of Sydney. The
  package is not intended to be used for other purposes; you are welcome to
  do so, but please note that the package may change without notice in order
  to suit changes to the associated taught course. All functions, arguments and
  classes are therefore subject to change without following any form of
  deprecation process.
